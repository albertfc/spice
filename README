SPICE is the firmware for the modular saturation unit from Plankton
Electronics (http://www.planktonelectronics.com/). SPICE offers huge variety of
sounds and colors, from subtle tube warmness to extreme fuzz distortion.

Currently, this firmware implements the digital distortion module and the
encoder control.

The code is designed to run in a Atmel AVR atmega328p, but easily should run in
any other AVR device with few modifications.

Compilation and upload
======================
$ ./build.sh
automatically prepares, compiles and uploads the code for supported OS. 

If your system is not supported, you can follow the next steps:

$ ./configure --host=avr
prepares code to be compiled on your system.

$ make
compiles everything.

$ make upload
uploads program to an AVR MCU using 'avrdude'.

$ ./configure --help
lists available compile time options.
